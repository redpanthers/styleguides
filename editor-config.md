# Editor configuration

Make sure you have configured your editor to maintain a consistent coding style.
When sending pull requests,
we shouldn't have basic problems
like inconsistent indentation.

For Ruby, we follow
[bbatsov/ruby-styleguide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#source-code-layout).

## Sublime

```json
# Preferences > Settings - User
{
  "tab_size": 2,
  "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true,
  "trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": true,
  "rulers": [79],
  # ...
}
```

## Vim

```vimscript
set shiftwidth=2
set tabstop=2
set expandtab
```

Apart from the basic settings above,
you can also use the
[vim-ruby](https://github.com/vim-ruby/vim-ruby)
plugin
to get smart indentation and other helpful features.

## VS Code

```json
# File > Preferences > User Settings:
{
  "editor.tabSize": 2,
  "editor.insertSpaces": true,
  # ...
}
```
